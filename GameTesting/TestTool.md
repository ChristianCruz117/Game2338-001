# Selenium

The test tool Iâ€™m going to be talking about is going to be Selenium. The company that developed Selenium is called ThoughtWorks 
in Chicago. One of the features that selenium has is that it can support all platforms (mac, linux, windows). Selenium can be 
installed, used for writing automation, and automation scripts can be executed on any of the platforms.The second feature it has 
is that it also supports all browsers for example chrome, i.e., Firefox, opera, and safari. The third features it has it also 
supports wide variety of languages for example java, c, c++, Objective C, Pearl, Python, ruby,haskle, javascript and html.
