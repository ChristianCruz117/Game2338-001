# TestComplete

The name of the test tool Iâ€™m going to be talking about is called TestComplete. The company who developed this test tool is called SmartBear Software. One of the features TestComplete has is that it can support many scpriting languages for example JaveScript, Python, VBScript, Jscript, DelphiScript, C++Script, C#Script, and VB. The second feature it has that it can automatically screenshots pictures during test recording and that it plays them back. This allows for us to compare quickly between the screenshots that are going to come later and actual screenshots during testing. The third feature it has a build in code editor that helps testers write scripts manually. 
It also includes a set of special plugins that help.
