# Game Testing Concepts

It takes dedication and determination to be a tester. 

I think the hardest part of being a game tester is trying to find the problems that the game has. 
By you trying to fix the problem, you could be potentially making new errors and won’t know until you start testing it. 
It’s also very hard to find a balance and send the player in the specific direction you want them to go. 
Also, on the weapons, vehicle and equipment, some of these items were not acting the way they should be.
They would go through things or be behind a player for no reason. 

I believe it takes a lot of time to test a game. I also thought they were dedicated on what 
to do and it was impressive to watch.
