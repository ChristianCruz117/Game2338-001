# Borderlands 2

## Summary

This game is about 4 new vault hunters with amazing skills and weapons, going on a quest to find an ancient vault full of treasure or so we
think. This is all happening in a planet called Pandora the most dangerous planet in the universe, but they get betrayed by a man named 
Jack during their job and left for dead in a frozen waste land. As you find Claptrap a really messed up robot he gets you to safety to the
original vault hunters who also don’t like Jack very much for the things he has done. So you go on a mission all around Pandora guns blazing
to stop Jack and his evil plan to try and open the mysterious vault he so much desires.  

## Final Thoughts

I thought this game was amazing. I loved the storyline and that they brought back characters from the old game as well but the weapons that
took the cake. New weapons that you could never think off what they could do. For example, hand guns, machine guns, snipers, shotguns, 
rocket launchers and grenades they could do so many crazy things it would take me a while to explain it all its that much. Also, there is 
such a vast number of weapons from the last game and they added a new element of elemental damage which if the enemy was affected by it any
other type of element for example fire would do 2 to 3 times more damage. The bosses design was pretty cool but some of their attacks were
unavoidable and a bit unfair sometimes but on new game plus that took it to a whole other level due to their difficulty level they would be
above the max level of the game the only way to beat them was with a full team, but it was so much fun. This game brought new content with
the DLC’s that the last game did not have. Most of the characters were different and they added two extra characters for the DLC that did 
different things from the last character design they were super cool. My favorite class the Mecromancer she can summon a robot that does
insane amount of damage and distracts enemies and explodes when he dies and does elemental damage and can float and reach any target where
ever he is hiding behind to take cover. Also he grows more powerful as you level up and gains more health and deals more damage and becomes
much bigger and scarier it’s like a more bad ass Frankenstein monster that kills everything in its path. Over all I love this game it was
amazing and pretty messed up.
