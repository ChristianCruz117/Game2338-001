# Final Thoughts
I loved this game when I first played it, it was so much fun! Each world was amazing and different and fun I never stopped playing that game I always take that game when I go travel back home thatâ€™s how much I really love this game. Out of all the games the Kirby game has my 2 favorites were Revenge of MetaKnight and Meta Nightmare Ultra. In the Revenge of MetaKnight game Kirby must go and defeat MetaKnight and I thought it was the coolest thing ever the cute pink mush mellow vs the edge lord. In the other game you literally play as MetaKnight I was shocked when I played it because it was completely different from Kirby which got me more into it. In this game you slash and dash playing as MetaKnight and he has different abilities that grant you health, speed boost, also a helper and ever an ultimate attack it was super cool. The most extreme part was that MetaKnight is trying to find the most powerful being in the universe and you must go and defeat it and that battle was so cool I really loved this game.
