Heroku allows you to make it easy to connect to your Github repo. It provides a way to test code in a easy to use environment.
Using Heroku makes it easy to make group projects because it keeps track of what everyone is doing with the program that the 
teams is working on and also it notifies you. Also it allows you to see every test run you and your team have made.

In the development environment, you are able to see the errors provided by running the Heroku CI. The CI helps you and your team
by providing a resource that continuously tests your code for errors.

Staging and Production from my understanding seem to work under the same main branch. You can keep staging and production environments
the same to catch flaws before your users do. The Heroku Chatops makes sure that you are only launching code with passing tests.

In conclusion, Heroku will help with an online game project by providing a better way to organize and work together within your team to 
provide solutions to your code. The CI will help your team save time by providing errors to run before production.
