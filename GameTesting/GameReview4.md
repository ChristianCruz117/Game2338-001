## Detail
Game Title: Angry Bird

## Summary
This game is about angry birds trying to kill pigs who stole their eggs. How you play the game, you have a giant sling shot where the 
birds get on and the you launch them toward the pigs to try to kill them but it is not as easy. As you go along the levels, it gets a lot 
harder because the pigs start making forts of wood, glass, and cement. That is why they have different types of birds. Each of the birds 
have their unique set of skill or super powers. Some can explode in a wide area and some can split and break glass much easier than 
others. Also, others can throw a bomb from the air and explode on impact. Over all the game is about tactics and throwing the birds at the
right angle to kill the pigs.


## Final Thoughts
I really loved this game whenever it came out. It was one of the most popular casual games at its time, I would be playing it all the time in class in middle school. This made you think a lot especially in the harder levels. Eventually the game would give you less birds to kill the pigs and you had to think also which part of the structure of the building you were going to hit to make the building fall just the right way so it kills the pigs. Also, if you finish the level only using one bird and you dont use the other birds, the game rewards you for not using them by giving you lots of point. This will include destroying the builings. In conclusion, this game is awesome. It makes you think how to throw the birds in the right angle into the builing and using the powers each one has and I love it.
