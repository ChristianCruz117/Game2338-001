## Detail
Game Title: Angry Bird

## Summary
This game is about angry birds trying to kill pigs who stole their eggs. How you play the game, you have a giant sling shot where the birds
get on and the you launch them toward the pigs to try to kill them but it is not as easy. As you go along the levels, it gets a lot harder 
because the pigs start making forts of wood, glass, and cement that's why they have different types of birds. Each of the birds have their 
unique set of skill or super powers. Some can explode in a wide area, some can split and break glass much easier than others. Overall,
some can throw a bomb from the air and explode on impact.
